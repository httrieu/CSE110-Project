# About Me

I am **Hunter Trieu** , I am a Computer Science Major currently attending the University of California, San Diego. This is my second year at UCSD, but I am a standing junior. Some programming languages I am proficient in are:
- Python
- Java
- C
- C++

My favorite of these is C because of the course I took on it (CSE30). I have experience in understanding data structures as well as understanding computer science with the following course work:

- CSE100
- CSE105
- CSE21

I currently have not been involved with any internships so far, but am searching for an opportunity. My most complicated piece of code would probably be for the graph traversals involved in CSE100, that follow this:

```
Traversal(start):
	To_visit = container to keep track of the nodes we need to visit
	Add start to to_visit
	While (to_visit != empty):
		Next_node = remove the next node in to_visit
		If next_node is not yet visited:
			Visit next_node
			For each unvisited neighbor node of next_node: 
add neighbor node to to_visit
```

### My Interests

I am an avid video game player. My top three games are as follows (and often switch order):

1. *The Witcher 3*
2. *Resident Evil*
3. *Bloodborne*

My favorite video game character is probably Geralt, whose famous line is,
> "If I'm to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all.‚Äù

I also play some online games. Most notably *Counter Strike: Global Offensive*, and *League of Legends*. I am not particularly good at either but if you want to find me on Steam [here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBoxFox1234/) is my profile, and [here](https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/thepoonpoon) is my OP.GG for *LoL*.
